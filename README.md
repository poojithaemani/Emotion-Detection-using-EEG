# Emotion Detection using EEG Signals
Electroencephalogram Signals (Brainwaves)

This Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is finely tuned for EEG signal classification using the DEAP dataset, achieving a commendable 91% accuracy during testing. The model is trained on combined EEG data from all participants, following an 80-20 split for training and testing data respectively. Its architecture comprises five convolutional layers, gradually broadening from 32 to 128 channels and then narrowing down to 16 channels. After the convolutional layers, a fully connected layer is included to enhance feature extraction and processing.
